# Question-generation-t5-model-RAG

This project is designed to automatically generate questions from PDF documents using a fine-tuned T5 transformer model. It leverages the capabilities of the T5 model to read the content of PDFs, process the text, and output multiple context-relevant questions. The tool is ideal for educators, content creators, or anyone needing automated question generation for assessments, quizzes, or summaries.
Features:
PDF Text Extraction: Extracts text content from PDF files.
Text Chunking: Splits large documents into manageable chunks for processing.
Question Generation: Generates multiple relevant questions for each chunk using the T5 model.
Multi-PDF Support: Allows processing of multiple PDFs in one run, generating questions for each file.
Fine-tuned T5 Model: Uses a pre-trained or fine-tuned version of the T5 model for question generation.

Customization:
Model: You can replace the t5-small model with a more advanced version (t5-base, t5-large, etc.) or your custom fine-tuned model.
PDF Paths: Modify the pdf_paths list to include paths to your PDFs.
Question Generation: Customize the number of questions generated by adjusting the parameters of the T5 model, such as num_return_sequences and num_beams.
